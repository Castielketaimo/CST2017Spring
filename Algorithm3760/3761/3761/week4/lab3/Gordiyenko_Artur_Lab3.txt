Algorithm efficiency of Sequential Search is O(n) for a single word, and O(n^2) for the entire testData provided, as we need to perform the search for each element in testData file).

Algorithm efficiency of Binary Search is O(log n) for a single word, and O(n) for the entire testData provided, as we need to perform the search for each element in testData file).


Binary search algorithm is significantly faster than sequential search, because the problem is decreased by half on every iteration, and the other half is discarded.





Side Note: I was using string concatenation ( string = string +  .. ), and the program took over 3 minutes to read the wordlist input.
Changing the concatenation to StringBuilder increased the input read time to approximately 3 seconds. It is possible String Builder and String concatenation have a similar time difference as the two algorithms created in lab.
