The Binary search Algorithm is much faster than Sequential Search.
If the size of testData is m, and wordlist is n.
The efficiency for Sequential Search is O(mn); for single key value: O(n)
The efficiency for the Binary Search is O(mlogn); for single key value: O(logn)

The reason that Binary search is faster is because binary search divdied the
problem into half each time it loops. It will only work with sorted list.
